## Introduction

Understanding wave propagation is fundamental across various scientific and engineering disciplines. The wave equation serves as a powerful mathematical tool to describe the dynamics of waves over time and space. This simulation aims to provide a visual representation of wave behavior for educational and exploratory purposes.

## Wave Equation Overview

The 2D wave equation is expressed as:

\[ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\right) \]

where:
- \(u\) represents the wave function,
- \(t\) denotes time,
- \(x\) and \(y\) are spatial coordinates,
- \(c\) is the wave velocity.

This equation establishes the relationship between the wave's acceleration (\(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}\)) and its spatial variations (\(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\)).

## Simulation Details

The Python simulation utilizes the Pygame library to create a graphical representation of the 2D wave equation. Key features include:
- Initiation of water droplet impact to kickstart the wave generation.
- Time-dependent propagation of waves.
- Implementation of absorbing boundary conditions to minimize wave reflections.
- Visualization of wave dynamics with color-coded intensity.
